# PyTorch Lightning (Claude Skill)

Deep learning framework (PyTorch Lightning / lightning package).

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Claude Skill |
| **Supplier** | [K-Dense Inc.](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills) (community OSS) |
| **Availability** | GA — part of the actively maintained K-Dense `scientific-agent-skills` collection |
| **Pricing** | Free / OSS (Apache-2.0) |
| **Capabilities** | Read/Write — Claude runs the skill's Python locally (Bash), not as an MCP tool |

## How to install

- **Claude Code / Claude.ai** — Skills CLI (recommended):
  ```
  npx skills add K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  ```
  Installs the K-Dense collection; enable the `pytorch-lightning` skill when prompted. Works across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex via the Agent Skills spec (requires Node ≥ 18).
- **Claude Code / Claude Desktop** — manual clone:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  cp -r scientific-agent-skills/skills/pytorch-lightning ~/.claude/skills/
  ```
  Project-scoped alternative: copy into `.claude/skills/` instead of `~/.claude/skills/`. The skill declares its own Python dependencies in its `SKILL.md`; install them (the K-Dense skills generally use `uv` / `pip`) when prompted on first use.

## What it does

Deep learning framework (PyTorch Lightning / lightning package). Organize PyTorch code into LightningModules, configure Trainers for multi-GPU/TPU, implement data pipelines, callbacks, logging (W&B, TensorBoard, MLflow), distributed training (DDP, FSDP, DeepSpeed), for scalable neural network training.

**Primary use cases**: Deep learning framework (PyTorch Lightning / lightning package).

## Notes

Distributed as a `SKILL.md` (plus code examples) in the K-Dense collection — Claude executes it locally via Bash/Python rather than as an MCP server. Upstream license: Apache-2.0. The skill name to enable after install is `pytorch-lightning`.
