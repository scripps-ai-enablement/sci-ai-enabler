# statsmodels (Claude Skill)

Statistical models library for Python.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Claude Skill |
| **Supplier** | [K-Dense Inc.](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills) (community OSS) |
| **Availability** | GA — part of the actively maintained K-Dense `scientific-agent-skills` collection |
| **Pricing** | Free / OSS (BSD-3-Clause) |
| **Capabilities** | Read/Write — Claude runs the skill's Python locally (Bash), not as an MCP tool |

## How to install

- **Claude Code / Claude.ai** — Skills CLI (recommended):
  ```
  npx skills add K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  ```
  Installs the K-Dense collection; enable the `statsmodels` skill when prompted. Works across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex via the Agent Skills spec (requires Node ≥ 18).
- **Claude Code / Claude Desktop** — manual clone:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  cp -r scientific-agent-skills/skills/statsmodels ~/.claude/skills/
  ```
  Project-scoped alternative: copy into `.claude/skills/` instead of `~/.claude/skills/`. The skill declares its own Python dependencies in its `SKILL.md`; install them (the K-Dense skills generally use `uv` / `pip`) when prompted on first use.

## What it does

Statistical models library for Python. Use when you need specific model classes (OLS, GLM, mixed models, ARIMA) with detailed diagnostics, residuals, and inference. Best for econometrics, time series, rigorous inference with coefficient tables. For guided statistical test selection with APA reporting use statistical-analysis.

**Primary use cases**: you need specific model classes (OLS, GLM, mixed models, ARIMA) with detailed diagnostics, residuals, and inference.

## Notes

Distributed as a `SKILL.md` (plus code examples) in the K-Dense collection — Claude executes it locally via Bash/Python rather than as an MCP server. Upstream license: BSD-3-Clause. The skill name to enable after install is `statsmodels`.
