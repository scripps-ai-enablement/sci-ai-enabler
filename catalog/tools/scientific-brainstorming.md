## How to install

<!-- alt-install:sciagent -->
- **Also packaged in the SciAgent-Skills collection** ([jaechang-hits](https://github.com/jaechang-hits/SciAgent-Skills) (community OSS, CC BY 4.0)): clone [`jaechang-hits/SciAgent-Skills`](https://github.com/jaechang-hits/SciAgent-Skills) and run `/plugin install sciagent-skills` in Claude Code (or copy `skills/scientific-writing/scientific-brainstorming` into `~/.claude/skills/`).
<!-- /alt-install:sciagent -->
- **Claude Code / Claude.ai** — Skills CLI (recommended):
  ```
  npx skills add K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  ```
  Installs the K-Dense collection; enable the `scientific-brainstorming` skill when prompted. Works across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex via the Agent Skills spec (requires Node ≥ 18).
- **Claude Code / Claude Desktop** — manual clone:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  cp -r scientific-agent-skills/skills/scientific-brainstorming ~/.claude/skills/
  ```
  Project-scoped alternative: copy into `.claude/skills/` instead of `~/.claude/skills/`. The skill declares its own Python dependencies in its `SKILL.md`; install them (the K-Dense skills generally use `uv` / `pip`) when prompted on first use.

## What it does

Creative research ideation and exploration. Use for open-ended brainstorming sessions, exploring interdisciplinary connections, challenging assumptions, or identifying research gaps. Best for early-stage research planning when you do not have specific observations yet. For formulating testable hypotheses from data use hypothesis-generation.

**Primary use cases**: open-ended brainstorming sessions, exploring interdisciplinary connections, challenging assumptions, or identifying research gaps.

## Notes

Distributed as a `SKILL.md` (plus code examples) in the K-Dense collection — Claude executes it locally via Bash/Python rather than as an MCP server. Upstream license: MIT. The skill name to enable after install is `scientific-brainstorming`.
