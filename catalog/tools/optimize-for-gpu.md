# Optimize for GPU (Claude Skill)

GPU-accelerate Python code using CuPy, Numba CUDA, Warp, cuDF, cuML, cuGraph, KvikIO, cuCIM, cuxfilter, cuVS, cuSpatial, and RAFT.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Claude Skill |
| **Supplier** | [K-Dense Inc.](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills) (community OSS) |
| **Availability** | GA — part of the actively maintained K-Dense `scientific-agent-skills` collection |
| **Pricing** | Free / OSS — license not stated upstream |
| **Capabilities** | Read/Write — Claude runs the skill's Python locally (Bash), not as an MCP tool |

## How to install

- **Claude Code / Claude.ai** — Skills CLI (recommended):
  ```
  npx skills add K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  ```
  Installs the K-Dense collection; enable the `optimize-for-gpu` skill when prompted. Works across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex via the Agent Skills spec (requires Node ≥ 18).
- **Claude Code / Claude Desktop** — manual clone:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  cp -r scientific-agent-skills/skills/optimize-for-gpu ~/.claude/skills/
  ```
  Project-scoped alternative: copy into `.claude/skills/` instead of `~/.claude/skills/`. The skill declares its own Python dependencies in its `SKILL.md`; install them (the K-Dense skills generally use `uv` / `pip`) when prompted on first use.

## What it does

GPU-accelerate Python code using CuPy, Numba CUDA, Warp, cuDF, cuML, cuGraph, KvikIO, cuCIM, cuxfilter, cuVS, cuSpatial, and RAFT. Use whenever the user mentions GPU/CUDA/NVIDIA acceleration, or wants to speed up NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, scikit-image, NetworkX, GeoPandas, or Faiss workloads. Covers physics simulation, differentiable rendering, mesh ray casting, particle systems (DEM/SPH/fluids), vector/similarity search, GPUDirect Storage file IO, interactive dashboards, geospatial analysis, medical imaging, and sparse eigensolvers. Also use when you see CPU-bound Python code (loops, large arrays, ML pipelines, graph analytics, image processing) that would benefit from GPU acceleration, even if not explicitly requested.

**Primary use cases**: GPU-accelerate Python code using CuPy, Numba CUDA, Warp, cuDF, cuML, cuGraph, KvikIO, cuCIM, cuxfilter, cuVS, cuSpatial, and RAFT.

## Notes

Distributed as a `SKILL.md` (plus code examples) in the K-Dense collection — Claude executes it locally via Bash/Python rather than as an MCP server. Upstream license: not stated upstream. The skill name to enable after install is `optimize-for-gpu`.
