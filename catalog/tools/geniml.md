# geniml (Claude Skill)

This skill should be used when working with genomic interval data (BED files) for machine learning tasks.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Claude Skill |
| **Supplier** | [K-Dense Inc.](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills) (community OSS) |
| **Availability** | GA — part of the actively maintained K-Dense `scientific-agent-skills` collection |
| **Pricing** | Free / OSS (BSD-2-Clause) |
| **Capabilities** | Read/Write — Claude runs the skill's Python locally (Bash), not as an MCP tool |

## How to install

- **Claude Code / Claude.ai** — Skills CLI (recommended):
  ```
  npx skills add K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  ```
  Installs the K-Dense collection; enable the `geniml` skill when prompted. Works across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex via the Agent Skills spec (requires Node ≥ 18).
- **Claude Code / Claude Desktop** — manual clone:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  cp -r scientific-agent-skills/skills/geniml ~/.claude/skills/
  ```
  Project-scoped alternative: copy into `.claude/skills/` instead of `~/.claude/skills/`. The skill declares its own Python dependencies in its `SKILL.md`; install them (the K-Dense skills generally use `uv` / `pip`) when prompted on first use.

## What it does

This skill should be used when working with genomic interval data (BED files) for machine learning tasks. Use for training region embeddings (Region2Vec, BEDspace), single-cell ATAC-seq analysis (scEmbed), building consensus peaks (universes), or any ML-based analysis of genomic regions. Applies to BED file collections, scATAC-seq data, chromatin accessibility datasets, and region-based genomic feature learning.

**Primary use cases**: training region embeddings (Region2Vec, BEDspace), single-cell ATAC-seq analysis (scEmbed), building consensus peaks (universes), or any ML-based analysis of genomic regions.

## Notes

Distributed as a `SKILL.md` (plus code examples) in the K-Dense collection — Claude executes it locally via Bash/Python rather than as an MCP server. Upstream license: BSD-2-Clause. The skill name to enable after install is `geniml`.
