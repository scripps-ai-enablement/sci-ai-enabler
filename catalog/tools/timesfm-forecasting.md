## How to install

- **Claude Code / Claude.ai** — Skills CLI (recommended):
  ```
  npx skills add K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  ```
  Installs the K-Dense collection; enable the `timesfm-forecasting` skill when prompted. Works across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex via the Agent Skills spec (requires Node ≥ 18).
- **Claude Code / Claude Desktop** — manual clone:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  cp -r scientific-agent-skills/skills/timesfm-forecasting ~/.claude/skills/
  ```
  Project-scoped alternative: copy into `.claude/skills/` instead of `~/.claude/skills/`. The skill declares its own Python dependencies in its `SKILL.md`; install them (the K-Dense skills generally use `uv` / `pip`) when prompted on first use.

## What it does

Zero-shot time series forecasting with Google's TimesFM foundation model. Use for any univariate time series (sales, sensors, energy, vitals, weather) without training a custom model. Supports CSV/DataFrame/array inputs with point forecasts and prediction intervals. Includes a preflight system checker script to verify RAM/GPU before first use.

**Primary use cases**: any univariate time series (sales, sensors, energy, vitals, weather) without training a custom model.

## Notes

Distributed as a `SKILL.md` (plus code examples) in the K-Dense collection — Claude executes it locally via Bash/Python rather than as an MCP server. Upstream license: Apache-2.0. The skill name to enable after install is `timesfm-forecasting`.
