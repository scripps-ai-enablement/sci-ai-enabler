# Exploratory Data Analysis (Claude Skill)

Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis on scientific data files across 200+ file formats.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Claude Skill |
| **Supplier** | [K-Dense Inc.](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills) (community OSS) |
| **Availability** | GA — part of the actively maintained K-Dense `scientific-agent-skills` collection |
| **Pricing** | Free / OSS (MIT) |
| **Capabilities** | Read/Write — Claude runs the skill's Python locally (Bash), not as an MCP tool |

## How to install

- **Claude Code / Claude.ai** — Skills CLI (recommended):
  ```
  npx skills add K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  ```
  Installs the K-Dense collection; enable the `exploratory-data-analysis` skill when prompted. Works across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex via the Agent Skills spec (requires Node ≥ 18).
- **Claude Code / Claude Desktop** — manual clone:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  cp -r scientific-agent-skills/skills/exploratory-data-analysis ~/.claude/skills/
  ```
  Project-scoped alternative: copy into `.claude/skills/` instead of `~/.claude/skills/`. The skill declares its own Python dependencies in its `SKILL.md`; install them (the K-Dense skills generally use `uv` / `pip`) when prompted on first use.

## What it does

Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis on scientific data files across 200+ file formats. This skill should be used when analyzing any scientific data file to understand its structure, content, quality, and characteristics. Automatically detects file type and generates detailed markdown reports with format-specific analysis, quality metrics, and downstream analysis recommendations. Covers chemistry, bioinformatics, microscopy, spectroscopy, proteomics, metabolomics, and general scientific data formats.

**Primary use cases**: Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis on scientific data files across 200+ file formats.

## Notes

Distributed as a `SKILL.md` (plus code examples) in the K-Dense collection — Claude executes it locally via Bash/Python rather than as an MCP server. Upstream license: MIT. The skill name to enable after install is `exploratory-data-analysis`.
