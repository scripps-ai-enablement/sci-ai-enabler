# popV (Claude Skill)

Consensus cell type annotation: runs 10+ algorithms (KNN-Harmony/BBKNN/Scanorama/scVI, CellTypist, ONCLASS, Random Forest, SCANVI, SVM, XGBoost) on a labeled reference and transfers labels via majority voting.

| **Type** | Claude Skill |
| **Supplier** | [jaechang-hits](https://github.com/jaechang-hits/SciAgent-Skills) (community OSS, CC BY 4.0) |
| **Availability** | GA — part of the BixBench-evaluated SciAgent-Skills collection |
| **Pricing** | Free / OSS (BSD-3-Clause) |
| **Capabilities** | Read/Write — Claude runs the skill's Python locally (Bash), not as an MCP tool |

## How to install

SciAgent-Skills is **not** an npm package — skills are plain markdown read directly by the agent (no `npx`/`npm`).

- **Claude Code** — clone and load as a plugin:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/jaechang-hits/SciAgent-Skills
  ```
  Then inside Claude Code run `/plugin install sciagent-skills` (verify it appears under `/plugin` → Installed). Clone into your project directory so Claude Code picks the skills up via `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Manual / other agents** — point the agent at the skill file directly:
  ```
  cp -r SciAgent-Skills/skills/genomics-bioinformatics/single-cell/popv-cell-annotation ~/.claude/skills/
  ```
  The skill declares its own Python dependencies in its `SKILL.md`; install them when prompted on first use.

## What it does

Consensus cell type annotation: runs 10+ algorithms (KNN-Harmony/BBKNN/Scanorama/scVI, CellTypist, ONCLASS, Random Forest, SCANVI, SVM, XGBoost) on a labeled reference and transfers labels via majority voting. Outputs per-method labels, consensus, agreement score. Use when single-method annotation is insufficient or you need ensemble uncertainty for novel states.

**Primary use cases**: single-method annotation is insufficient or you need ensemble uncertainty for novel states.

## Notes

Distributed as a `SKILL.md` (plus code examples) in the SciAgent-Skills collection — Claude executes it locally via Bash/Python rather than as an MCP server. Upstream license: BSD-3-Clause. The skill directory upstream is `skills/genomics-bioinformatics/single-cell/popv-cell-annotation`.
