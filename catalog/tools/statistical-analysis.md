# Statistical Analysis (Claude Skill)

Guided statistical analysis with test selection and reporting.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Claude Skill |
| **Supplier** | [K-Dense Inc.](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills) (community OSS) |
| **Availability** | GA — part of the actively maintained K-Dense `scientific-agent-skills` collection |
| **Pricing** | Free / OSS (MIT) |
| **Capabilities** | Read/Write — Claude runs the skill's Python locally (Bash), not as an MCP tool |

## How to install

<!-- alt-install:sciagent -->
- **Also packaged in the SciAgent-Skills collection** ([jaechang-hits](https://github.com/jaechang-hits/SciAgent-Skills) (community OSS, CC BY 4.0)): clone [`jaechang-hits/SciAgent-Skills`](https://github.com/jaechang-hits/SciAgent-Skills) and run `/plugin install sciagent-skills` in Claude Code (or copy `skills/biostatistics/statistical-analysis` into `~/.claude/skills/`).
<!-- /alt-install:sciagent -->
- **Claude Code / Claude.ai** — Skills CLI (recommended):
  ```
  npx skills add K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  ```
  Installs the K-Dense collection; enable the `statistical-analysis` skill when prompted. Works across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex via the Agent Skills spec (requires Node ≥ 18).
- **Claude Code / Claude Desktop** — manual clone:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  cp -r scientific-agent-skills/skills/statistical-analysis ~/.claude/skills/
  ```
  Project-scoped alternative: copy into `.claude/skills/` instead of `~/.claude/skills/`. The skill declares its own Python dependencies in its `SKILL.md`; install them (the K-Dense skills generally use `uv` / `pip`) when prompted on first use.

## What it does

Guided statistical analysis with test selection and reporting. Use when you need help choosing appropriate tests for your data, assumption checking, power analysis, and APA-formatted results. Best for academic research reporting, test selection guidance. For implementing specific models programmatically use statsmodels.

**Primary use cases**: you need help choosing appropriate tests for your data, assumption checking, power analysis, and APA-formatted results.

## Notes

Distributed as a `SKILL.md` (plus code examples) in the K-Dense collection — Claude executes it locally via Bash/Python rather than as an MCP server. Upstream license: MIT. The skill name to enable after install is `statistical-analysis`.
