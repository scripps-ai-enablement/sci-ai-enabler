## How to install

- **Claude Code / Claude.ai** — Skills CLI (recommended):
  ```
  npx skills add K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  ```
  Installs the K-Dense collection; enable the `pacsomatic` skill when prompted. Works across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex via the Agent Skills spec (requires Node ≥ 18).
- **Claude Code / Claude Desktop** — manual clone:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  cp -r scientific-agent-skills/skills/pacsomatic ~/.claude/skills/
  ```
  Project-scoped alternative: copy into `.claude/skills/` instead of `~/.claude/skills/`. The skill declares its own Python dependencies in its `SKILL.md`; install them (the K-Dense skills generally use `uv` / `pip`) when prompted on first use.

## What it does

Operator toolkit for nf-core/pacsomatic matched tumor-normal workflows from BAM inputs. Use this skill when the user needs to validate run inputs, generate pacsomatic-compliant samplesheets, prepare reproducible Nextflow launch artifacts, run locally or submit to schedulers (LSF/Slurm/PBS/SGE), and triage execution failures. Triggers on requests to run pacsomatic, prepare launch commands/scripts, perform dry-run checks, or troubleshoot pipeline startup and scheduler submission errors.

**Primary use cases**: the user needs to validate run inputs, generate pacsomatic-compliant samplesheets, prepare reproducible Nextflow launch artifacts, run locally or submit to schedulers (LSF/Slurm/PBS/SGE), and triage execution failures.

## Notes

Distributed as a `SKILL.md` (plus code examples) in the K-Dense collection — Claude executes it locally via Bash/Python rather than as an MCP server. Upstream license: MIT. The skill name to enable after install is `pacsomatic`.
