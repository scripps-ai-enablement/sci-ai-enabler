# GeoMaster (Claude Skill)

Comprehensive geospatial science skill covering remote sensing, GIS, spatial analysis, machine learning for earth observation, and 30+ scientific domains.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Claude Skill |
| **Supplier** | [K-Dense Inc.](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills) (community OSS) |
| **Availability** | GA — part of the actively maintained K-Dense `scientific-agent-skills` collection |
| **Pricing** | Free / OSS (MIT) |
| **Capabilities** | Read/Write — Claude runs the skill's Python locally (Bash), not as an MCP tool |
| **Verified** | works · 2026-07-20 |
| **Security** | cleared · 2026-07-20 — provenance matches K-Dense-AI, MIT repo, maintained, no OSV advisories |

## How to install

- **Claude Code / Claude.ai** — Skills CLI (recommended):
  ```
  npx skills add K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  ```
  Installs the K-Dense collection; enable the `geomaster` skill when prompted. Works across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex via the Agent Skills spec (requires Node ≥ 18).
- **Claude Code / Claude Desktop** — manual clone:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  cp -r scientific-agent-skills/skills/geomaster ~/.claude/skills/
  ```
  Project-scoped alternative: copy into `.claude/skills/` instead of `~/.claude/skills/`. The skill declares its own Python dependencies in its `SKILL.md`; install them (the K-Dense skills generally use `uv` / `pip`) when prompted on first use.

## What it does

Comprehensive geospatial science skill covering remote sensing, GIS, spatial analysis, machine learning for earth observation, and 30+ scientific domains. Supports satellite imagery processing (Sentinel, Landsat, MODIS, SAR, hyperspectral), vector and raster data operations, spatial statistics, point cloud processing, network analysis, cloud-native workflows (STAC, COG, Planetary Computer), and 8 programming languages (Python, R, Julia, JavaScript, C++, Java, Go, Rust) with 500+ code examples. Use for remote sensing workflows, GIS analysis, spatial ML, Earth observation data processing, terrain analysis, hydrological modeling, marine spatial analysis, atmospheric science, and any geospatial computation task.

**Primary use cases**: remote sensing workflows, GIS analysis, spatial ML, Earth observation data processing, terrain analysis, hydrological modeling, marine spatial analysis, atmospheric science, and any geospatial computation task.

## Notes

Distributed as a `SKILL.md` (plus code examples) in the K-Dense collection — Claude executes it locally via Bash/Python rather than as an MCP server. Upstream license: MIT. The skill name to enable after install is `geomaster`.
