# QuTiP (Claude Skill)

Quantum physics simulation library for open quantum systems.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Claude Skill |
| **Supplier** | [K-Dense Inc.](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills) (community OSS) |
| **Availability** | GA — part of the actively maintained K-Dense `scientific-agent-skills` collection |
| **Pricing** | Free / OSS (BSD-3-Clause) |
| **Capabilities** | Read/Write — Claude runs the skill's Python locally (Bash), not as an MCP tool |
| **Verified** | works · 2026-07-20 |
| **Security** | cleared · 2026-07-20 — provenance matches K-Dense-AI, MIT repo, maintained, no OSV advisories |

## How to install

- **Claude Code / Claude.ai** — Skills CLI (recommended):
  ```
  npx skills add K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  ```
  Installs the K-Dense collection; enable the `qutip` skill when prompted. Works across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex via the Agent Skills spec (requires Node ≥ 18).
- **Claude Code / Claude Desktop** — manual clone:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  cp -r scientific-agent-skills/skills/qutip ~/.claude/skills/
  ```
  Project-scoped alternative: copy into `.claude/skills/` instead of `~/.claude/skills/`. The skill declares its own Python dependencies in its `SKILL.md`; install them (the K-Dense skills generally use `uv` / `pip`) when prompted on first use.

## What it does

Quantum physics simulation library for open quantum systems. Use when studying master equations, Lindblad dynamics, decoherence, quantum optics, or cavity QED. Best for physics research, open system dynamics, and educational simulations. NOT for circuit-based quantum computing—use qiskit, cirq, or pennylane for quantum algorithms and hardware execution.

**Primary use cases**: studying master equations, Lindblad dynamics, decoherence, quantum optics, or cavity QED.

## Notes

Distributed as a `SKILL.md` (plus code examples) in the K-Dense collection — Claude executes it locally via Bash/Python rather than as an MCP server. Upstream license: BSD-3-Clause. The skill name to enable after install is `qutip`.
