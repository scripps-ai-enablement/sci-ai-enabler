## How to install

<!-- alt-install:sciagent -->
- **Also packaged in the SciAgent-Skills collection** ([jaechang-hits](https://github.com/jaechang-hits/SciAgent-Skills) (community OSS, CC BY 4.0)): clone [`jaechang-hits/SciAgent-Skills`](https://github.com/jaechang-hits/SciAgent-Skills) and run `/plugin install sciagent-skills` in Claude Code (or copy `skills/scientific-writing/scientific-critical-thinking` into `~/.claude/skills/`).
<!-- /alt-install:sciagent -->
- **Claude Code / Claude.ai** — Skills CLI (recommended):
  ```
  npx skills add K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  ```
  Installs the K-Dense collection; enable the `scientific-critical-thinking` skill when prompted. Works across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex via the Agent Skills spec (requires Node ≥ 18).
- **Claude Code / Claude Desktop** — manual clone:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  cp -r scientific-agent-skills/skills/scientific-critical-thinking ~/.claude/skills/
  ```
  Project-scoped alternative: copy into `.claude/skills/` instead of `~/.claude/skills/`. The skill declares its own Python dependencies in its `SKILL.md`; install them (the K-Dense skills generally use `uv` / `pip`) when prompted on first use.

## What it does

Evaluate scientific claims and evidence quality. Use for assessing experimental design validity, identifying biases and confounders, applying evidence grading frameworks (GRADE, Cochrane Risk of Bias), or teaching critical analysis. Best for understanding evidence quality, identifying flaws. For formal peer review writing use peer-review.

**Primary use cases**: assessing experimental design validity, identifying biases and confounders, applying evidence grading frameworks (GRADE, Cochrane Risk of Bias), or teaching critical analysis.

## Notes

Distributed as a `SKILL.md` (plus code examples) in the K-Dense collection — Claude executes it locally via Bash/Python rather than as an MCP server. Upstream license: MIT. The skill name to enable after install is `scientific-critical-thinking`.
