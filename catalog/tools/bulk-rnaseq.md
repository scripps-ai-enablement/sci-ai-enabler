# Bulk RNA-seq (Claude Skill)

End-to-end bulk RNA-seq orchestrator — takes raw FASTQ reads through QC and trimming (FastQC, fastp/Trim Galore), alignment and quantification (STAR, Salmon, featureCounts), assembles a gene-level counts matrix, then hands off to differential expression (pydeseq2), pathway/GSEA enrichment (pathway-enrichment), and publication figures (scientific-visualization).

|---|---|
| **Type** | Claude Skill |
| **Supplier** | [K-Dense Inc.](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills) (community OSS) |
| **Availability** | GA — part of the actively maintained K-Dense `scientific-agent-skills` collection |
| **Pricing** | Free / OSS (MIT) |
| **Capabilities** | Read/Write — Claude runs the skill's Python locally (Bash), not as an MCP tool |

## How to install

- **Claude Code / Claude.ai** — Skills CLI (recommended):
  ```
  npx skills add K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  ```
  Installs the K-Dense collection; enable the `bulk-rnaseq` skill when prompted. Works across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex via the Agent Skills spec (requires Node ≥ 18).
- **Claude Code / Claude Desktop** — manual clone:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
  cp -r scientific-agent-skills/skills/bulk-rnaseq ~/.claude/skills/
  ```
  Project-scoped alternative: copy into `.claude/skills/` instead of `~/.claude/skills/`. The skill declares its own Python dependencies in its `SKILL.md`; install them (the K-Dense skills generally use `uv` / `pip`) when prompted on first use.

## What it does

End-to-end bulk RNA-seq orchestrator — takes raw FASTQ reads through QC and trimming (FastQC, fastp/Trim Galore), alignment and quantification (STAR, Salmon, featureCounts), assembles a gene-level counts matrix, then hands off to differential expression (pydeseq2), pathway/GSEA enrichment (pathway-enrichment), and publication figures (scientific-visualization). Use whenever the user has bulk RNA-seq reads or quant output and wants a complete, reproducible differential-expression workflow — e.g. "analyze my RNA-seq", "FASTQ to DESeq2", "run nf-core/rnaseq", "STAR/Salmon quantification", "build a counts matrix for DESeq2", or "go from reads to differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways". Routes between an nf-core/rnaseq (Nextflow) path and a standalone STAR/Salmon path, and covers experimental design, strandedness, and QC gates. For single-cell RNA-seq use the scanpy skill instead.

**Primary use cases**: End-to-end bulk RNA-seq orchestrator — takes raw FASTQ reads through QC and trimming (FastQC, fastp/Trim Galore), alignment and quantification (STAR, Salmon, featureCounts), assembles a gene-level counts matrix, then hands off to differential expression (pydeseq2), pathway/GSEA enrichment (pathway-enrichment), and publication figures (scientific-visualization).

## Notes

Distributed as a `SKILL.md` (plus code examples) in the K-Dense collection — Claude executes it locally via Bash/Python rather than as an MCP server. Upstream license: MIT. The skill name to enable after install is `bulk-rnaseq`.
