# Verifier state

Working memory for the [Verifier agent](https://github.com/scripps-ai-enablement/sci-ai-enabler/blob/main/VERIFIER_AGENT.md).
It owns the `verification` / `security` stamps on catalog entries; the catalog curator
(`catalog/curator-state.md`) owns everything else.

## Recently verified

_None yet — bootstrap pass not started._

## Flagged (broken or security)

_None._

## Deferred — next-run priority

_None._

## Smoke-test queue

The `scripts/select_smoke_targets.py` selector is authoritative for what the quarantined smoke job
may install/boot (open, no-auth, no-cost Skills/MCP servers only). List slugs here to prioritize the
next run's smoke batch; leave empty to let the selector pick by age.

_None._
